# S-Discord-Bot

## Overview

This is a multi-purpose discord bot I made.
To use reaction roles and custom prefixes, you will have to set up the proper .json files.
For the missing info such as the client ID and reddit information, you will have to fill those in yourself.
Otherwise, it should be functional.
